# SurfILE: surface and profile analysis
Python library for analyzing topographic features of surfaces from
- areal surface data -- __Surf__-ace
- profiles -- prof-__ile__

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The project is intended to be an easy to use tool box providing multiple algorithms to analyze areal surface topographies: areal height maps and profiles.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

<!-- GOAL -->
## Goal
The project aims to provide easy-to-use Python programs for analysing areal surface topographies and profiles:
- as a tool box of algorithms to estimate geometry parameters of spheres, cylinders, gratings (height and pitch), etc
- in the field of surface metrology for users
    - who want the flexibility to adapt their data processing to their own needs by modifying and adding code as required
    - who need to process large amounts of measurement data for automatic analysis (such as 20 to 100 topography maps of repetitive measurements)
- for beginners as well as for those experts who need a quick and easy way to solve their tasks
